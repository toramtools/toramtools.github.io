- Ignite damage on monsters depends on MATK, INT, DEX and Magic Resistance. 
When MATK=0, Ignite damage is (Total INT + Total Dex) * (1 - Magic Resistance % / 100). This is a very reliable way to find Magic Resistance.
Although, full formula for ignite damage is unknown. It's known that MATK/Ignite DMG is nearly constant, but this constant varies from monster to monster.

- Weaken crit related part only applies for advantageous elements. This means finale isn't affected by weaken.

- Bow rules for element:
* If arrow hasn't element or no arrow is equiped, element is taken from bow (unless skill has fixed element);
* If arrow has element and bow too, arrow element takes priority even if bow element is advantageous;
* Bow skills with fixed element have dual element with arrow.

- ATK/MATK UP (STAT) only applies to base stats (coryn wrongly applies to total stat).

- Brave aura and Long Range Mastery don't share same step (1*1.1*1.2 instead 1+0.1+0.2). Brave aura's weapon atk% is applied only to main hand.

- DW AUTO: baseDMG main + baseDMG sub, include def/lv/pres in both steps (ofc).
